This folder contains example data from IsGISAXS for comparison with GISASFW

In each subdirectory, one finds:
- README with example description
- one or multiple .inp files, containing IsGISAXS model description
- isgi_*.ima files with simulated intensity produced by IsGISAXS

List of examples:
ex-1  2 types of particles (cylinder, prism3) on top of substrate. No interference function.
ex-3  cylinder form factor
ex-9  pyramid form factor
ex-10 cylinders with interference on top of substrate

Some notes:
-Since polarization (x-ray) is not yet included in GISASFW, this feature should be disabled in IsGISAXS by returning 1._wp from function PolFac in Reflectivity_mod.f90
-IsGISAXS initializes the arrays of outgoing angles such that their sines are evenly spaced. This necessitates a different initialization in GISASFW too: see GISASExperiment::setDetectorParameters function
-In the subdirectory scripts/ , one can find python scripts that can be used to compare the different simulation outputs
