BornAgain fitting examples.

In this directory one can find examples of complete applications
used for fitting.

--- ex001_SampleParametersIntro ---
    This example shows how to create a sample with fixed parameters and then
    change this parameters on the fly during runtime.
    The example doesn't contain any fitting and serve as a gentle introduction
    to other fitting examples.

--- ex002_FitCylindersAndPrisms ---
    The model "mixture of cylinders and prisms without interference"
    will be used to fit real data.
    FitCylindersAndPrisms.py shows minimal fitting example
    FitCylindersAndPrisms_detailed.py is more detailed version + some graphical output

--- ex003_FitSpheresInHexLattice ---
    Two parameter fit of spheres in a hex lattice.
    FitSpheresInHexLattice.py - demonstrate standard approach
    FitSpheresInHexLattice_builder.py - shows advanced way using sample builder, which might be useful for complex
    samples
