This folder demonstrates how to use the BornAgain C++ API.

Using this API, one can write C++ programs that use libBornAgainCore
to perform simulations, and libBornAgainFit to perform fits. This
may be of interest when integrating BornAgain into a larger framework.

In general, however, it is much more convenient to run BornAgain
through its Python API.

THEREFORE, THIS C++ EXAMPLE DIRECTORY IS CURRENTLY NOT MAINTAINED
AND MAY BE OUT OF PHASE.

Currently, this directory contains only one example:

SimulateAndRootplot/
   Simulate a mixture of uncorrelated cylinders and prisms, and
   plot results using CERN Root.
