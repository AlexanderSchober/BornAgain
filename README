This is the GISASFW framework.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Package content:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
./Core       - the main library of the framework
./App        - functional tests
./ThirdParty - third party libraries
./UnitTests  - collection of cpp unit tests
./Examples   - usage examples
./Doc        - documentation


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Installation Instructions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------
External libraries
------------------
* Core depend on: _gsl gslcblas fftw3 boost(>1.46)_
* App depend on: _ROOT_
* _python>=2.6 and Qt>=4.5_

------------------
Installation
------------------
~ cd <to_the_package_directory>
~ qmake; make
* 'make clean', and more powerfull 'make distclean' are also available

------------------
Checked on 
------------------
*  MacOS 10.7.3
*  OpenSuse 12.1
*  CentOS 5.1 with JCNS setup (see issue below)

------------------
Issue with CentOS from JCNS
------------------
~  export LC_ALL=C; qmake CONFIG+=JCNS; make
* Explanation: PCs at JCNS are equipped with CentOS linux with set of official software at /usr/local.
  So far two issues affecting framework installation have been found.
  1) _fftw3_ compiled only statically, shared version is missed
  2) _boost1.46_ is buggy, see https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/5928 or google for "locale::facet::_S_create_c_locale name not valid"
  As a temporary workaround one system variable has to be defined, one additional
  CONFIG option has to be used as shown in example above.

How to install ROOT
------------------
* ROOT is extremely powerfull and exceptionally supported C++ based analysis framework, see http://root.cern.ch.
  Framework has to be installed to be able to compile App part (containing functional tests). You do not need to install
  ROOT to have only Core library.

------------------
Installation
------------------
* download source from http://root.cern.ch, unpack it somewhere
* define variable pointing to the directory where ROOT will be installed
  export ROOTSYS=/home/jamesbond/software/root
* go to the directory where you unpacked ROOT and run
  ./configure; make; make install
* _in the unlikely case of failure, see more installation instruction on ROOT site_

------------------
Steps after installation
------------------
* ROOT requires PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH variables to be defined
* the easiest way to do it is to run "source /home/jamesbond/software/root/bin/thisroot.sh" each time you are going to use ROOT
* simply put this call in your .bash_profile
* or put in your .bash_profile
  export ROOTSYS=/home/jamesbond/software/root
  export PATH=$ROOTSYS/bin:$PATH
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ROOTSYS/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

------------------
If you are JCNS user
------------------
* You can use privatelly installed version by running
  source /usr/users/jcns/pospelov/software/root/current/bin/thisroot.sh
* If you compile ROOT by yourself on one of JCNS machines, remember about missed shared fftw3 library there. Easiest way to configure ROOT without this library.
  ./configure --disable-fftw3; make; make install
