How to use the release script.

1. cd to some empty directory
2. git clone git://apps.jcns.fz-juelich.de/BornAgain.git
3. git checkout develop
4. change the release number in BornAgain/CMakeLists.txt (also in BornAgain/Doc/UserManual/CMakeLists.txt if a new version of the manual is needed)
5. create the build directory somewhere outside the source tree
6. cd path-to-build-directory
7. cmake path-to-source-dir
8. run script path-to-build-dir/bin/release.sh
