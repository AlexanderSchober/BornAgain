Quick Start
===================================

This tutorial demonstrates how to run the simulation and get simulated intensity data image in a few mouse clicks.


**1. Run BornAgain Graphical User Interface**

Use BornAgain icon |BornAgainIcon| located on the desktop (Windows) or look for it on Launchpad (MacOS) to start GUI.

          :align: top


For Linux users run an executable located in BornAgain installation directory from command line

.. code-block:: bash

  $ <install_dir>/bin/BornAgain

  
**2. Switch to the Sample View**

   :align: center
   :target: ../../_static/gui_quickstart1.png

Switch to the Sample View by clicking on the pictogram marked on the left panel.


**3. Construct the sample**

   :target: ../../_static/gui_quickstart2.png


Drag predefined standard sample with the name Example#1  from item toolbox and drop it on canvas.

   :align: center
   :target: ../../_static/gui_quickstart2b.png

You will get a sample representing a multilayer with two types of particles on top of substrate   
   
**4. Run the simulation**


.. image:: ../../_static/gui_quickstart3_700.png
   :align: center
   :target: ../../_static/gui_quickstart3.png

Switch to the Simulation View and press Run Simulation button.


.. image:: ../../_static/gui_quickstart3b_700.png
   :align: center
   :target: ../../_static/gui_quickstart3b.png

When simulation is completed, the current view will be automatically switched to the Jobs View showing the intensity data results.
