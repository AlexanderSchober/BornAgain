CMake configuration fails
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

CMake might fail with the error message::

    Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!

or similar if some of the third party libraries are not installed on the system, or cmake is not able to find them.
Please send us the log file ``my_cmake.log`` generated by running the following command in the empty ``<build_dir>``

.. code-block:: bash

    cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<install_dir> <source_dir> >& my_cmake.log





Compilation fails
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the case of a complex system setup, with libraries of different versions 
scattered across multiple places ``cmake`` might make an error in identifying correct paths to the libraries or include directories.
This might lead at some point to the compilation failure.
This might happen, for example, during compilation of BornAgain graphical user interface if the system has both Qt4 and Qt5 libraries installed.
Please send us the build log generated by running following make command

.. code-block:: bash

    make VERBOSE=1 >& my_build.log
