\section{Introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The Form factor of a hard-shell particle is simply its \E{shape transform},
as introduced in~(\ref{EFFhardshell}),
\begin{equation}\label{EFF_SFF2}
  F(\q)=\int_V\!\d^3r\, \e^{i\q\r},
\end{equation}
where $V$ delimits the volume of the particle.
Here we show for a few selected cases
how to bring the analytical solution of this integral into a form
 suitable for speedy and stable computation.
This background material probably is of interest only for
developers who want to add some more form factors to \BornAgain's collection
(catalogued in App.~\ref{SFF}).

\index{Form factor!bound for absolute value}%
From~(\ref{EFF_SFF2}), it is immediately clear that~$F(\q)$ is bounded by
\begin{equation}
  |F(\q)|\le V,
\end{equation}
with equality holding for~$\q=0$.
This excludes the presence of nonremovable singularities.
However, analytical solutions of~(\ref{EFF_SFF2}) do contain
removable singularities.
These singularities must be investigated closely
in order to prevent floating-point errors and ill conditioned computations.

\index{Form factor!singularities}%
It seems that \E{all} analytical form factors have a singularity at~$\q=0$.
Furthermore, if the particle has \E{plane} surfaces,
then there is a singularity for all $\q$ that lie in one of these planes.
A simple example is provided by the cuboid form factor (Sect.~\ref{SBox})
\begin{equation}
F= L W H\exp\left(i q_z \frac{H}{2}\right) \sinc\left(q_x \frac{L}{2}\right)
\sinc\left(q_y \frac{W}{2}\right) \sinc\left(q_z \frac{H}{2}\right).
\end{equation}
If the \E{sinus cardinalis} is written as
\index{Sinus cardinalis@Sinus cardinalis (sinc)!removable singularity}
\begin{equation}
  \sinc(u) = \frac{\sin(u)}{u},
\end{equation}
then there appears to be a singularity at $u=0$.
Applying L'Hôpital's rule, it is obvious
that this singularity can be removed by the interpolated value
$\sinc(0)=1$,
as is done in the generally agreed definition of the special function~$\sinc$.

While all this is clear and easy,
computations become more involved
if a particle has planes with normals that are not oriented along
any of the axes of the Cartesian coordinate system.
Typically then, the straightforward analytical solution of~(\ref{EFF_SFF2})
results in messy expressions that obscure the symmetries of~$F(\q)$,
and make it difficult to recognize the singularities and
to remove them.
Therefore we shall consider a few such cases more closely.

% TODO? another concern: integrals without numeric solution

\section{Regular polyhedron}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

To compute the two-dimensional form factor
of a regular $n$-gon in a systematic way,
we decompose the polygon into~$n$ isosceles triangles
with vertex angles of $2\eta\coloneqq2\pi/n$.
Thus the form factor shall be computed as
\begin{equation}
  F(\q) = \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \Gamma(D^{2j}\q)
\end{equation}
with the rotation matrix
\begin{equation}
  D\coloneqq\left(\begin{array}{ll}\cos\eta&\sin\eta\\
                          -\sin\eta&\cos\eta\end{array}\right).
\end{equation}
The form factor of one triangle is given by
\begin{equation}
  \Gamma(\q)
  =\int_0^{R\cos\eta}\!\d x\,\e^{iq_x x}
   \int_{-R\tan\eta}^{+R\tan\eta}\!\d y\,\e^{iq_yy}.
\end{equation}
Straightforward calculation yields
\begin{equation}\label{EngonG}
  \Gamma(\q)
  = \frac{\cos\eta}{\hy\q}\left(
    \frac{1-\e^{i\hx D\q R}}{\hx D\q}
   -\frac{1-\e^{i\hx D^{-1}\q R}}{\hx D^{-1}\q}\right).
\end{equation}
The singularities at $\hx D\q=0$ or $\hx D^{-1}\q=0$ are obviously removable.
To investigate the singularity at~$\hy\q=0$,
we let $\q=a\hx+\epsilon\hy$.
Then $\hx D^{\pm1}\q = a\cos\eta\pm\epsilon\sin\eta$,
and
\begin{equation}\label{EngonGsing3}
  \Gamma(\q) = \frac{2\cos\eta\,\sin\eta
  \left\{ -1+\left[\cos(\epsilon R\cos\eta)
        -iaR\cos\eta\sinc(\epsilon R\sin\eta)\right]\e^{iaR\cos\eta}\right\}}
{a^2\cos^2\eta-\epsilon^2\sin^2\eta}.
\end{equation}
For $\eta\to0$ at finite~$a$, the only singularity is in the sinc function,
hence it is removable.
Finally, for the singularity at $q\to0$, we choose $\epsilon=0$ and
expand~(\ref{EngonGsing3}) for $a\to0$,
which yields
\begin{equation}
  \Gamma(0) = R^2\,\sin\eta\,\cos\eta,
\end{equation}
which is the surface of the triangle, as it ought to be.

of $\epsilon=2^{-52}\simeq2.2\cdot10^{-16}$.
