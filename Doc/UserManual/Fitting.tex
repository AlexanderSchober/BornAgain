In addition to the simulation of grazing incidence
X-ray and neutron scattering by
multilayered samples, \BornAgain\ also offers the option to
fit the numerical model to reference data by modifying a selection of
sample parameters from the numerical model.  This aspect
of the software is discussed in the current chapter.

%\SecRef{FittingGentleIntroducion} gives a short introduction to the
%basic concepts of data fitting. Users familiar with fitting can
%directly proceed to \SecRef{FittingImplementation}, which details the
%implementation of fittings in 
%\BornAgain\ . 
\SecRef{FittingImplementation} details the
implementation of fittings in \BornAgain\ . 
\Python\ fitting examples with detailed
explanations of every fitting step are given in \SecRef{FittingExamples}. Advanced fitting techniques, including fine tuning of minimization
algorithms, simultaneous fits of different data sets, parameters
correlation, are covered in
\SecRef{FittingAdvanced}. \SecRef{FittingRightAnswers} contains some practical advice, which might
help the user to get right answers from \BornAgain\ fitting.
