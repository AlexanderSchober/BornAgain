\chapter{Modelling a GISAS experiment}  \label{sec:Exp}

To fit experimental data, it is not sufficient to simulate
the scattering of plane waves by the sample.
To account for actual detector images,
we must compute intensities in appropriate coordinates,
and account for the finite instrument resolution.

\section{Detector images}\label{Sdetimg}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%In this section we describe the conversion between the scattering vector~$\q$
%and the experimental coordinates.

%The experimental geometry has already been introduced in Fig.~\ref{fig:expgeom}.
