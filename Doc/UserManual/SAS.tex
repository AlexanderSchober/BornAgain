\chaptermark{Small-angle scattering}

\index{Small-angle scattering|(}%

This chapter introduces the basic theory of small-angle scattering (SAS).
We specifically consider scalar neutron propagation,
adjourning the notationally more involved
vectorial theory of X-rays and polarized neutrons
to a later edition. % TODO REVERT TEMPORARY % to the later \cref{SPol}.
Our exposition is self-contained,
except for the initial passage from the microscopic
to the macroscopic Schrödinger equation,
which we outline only briefly (\Cref{Swave}).
The standard description of scattering in first order Born approximation
is introduced in a way that is suitable subsequent modification
into the distorted wave Born approximation
needed for grazing-incidence small-angle scattering (\Cref{SBornApprox}).

Finally, we discuss how the physical scattering law
(the double differential cross section as function of the scattering vector~$\q$)
relates to the experimental detector image (\Cref{SdetImg}).

\begin{equation}\label{ESchrodi}
  i\hbar\partial_t \psi(\r,t)
  = \left\{-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\Nabla^2+V(\r)\right\} \psi(\r,t).
\end{equation}
By assuming a time-independent potential $V(\r)$,
we have excluded inelastic scattering.
Therefore we only need to consider monochromatic waves
with given frequency~$\omega$.
\nomenclature[1ω 020]{$\omega$}{Frequency of incident radiation}%
In consequence, we have a stationary wavefunction
\begin{equation}\label{Estationarywave}
  \psi(\r,t) = \psi(\r)\e^{-i\omega t}.
\end{equation}
\nomenclature[1ψ030 2r040 0]{$\psi(\r)$}{Stationary wavefunction}%
The minus sign in the exponent of the phase factor
is an inevitable consequence of the standard form of the Schrödinger equation,
and is therefore called the \E{quantum-mechanical sign convention}.
\index{Wave propagation|seealso {Sign convention}}%
\index{Sign convention!wave propagation}%
\index{Conventions|see {Sign convention}}%
For electromagnetic radiation
usage is less uniform.
While most optics textbooks
have adopted the quantum-mechanical convention~\cref{Estationarywave},
in X-ray crystallography
the conjugate phase factor $\e^{+i\omega t}$ is prefered.
This \E{crystallographic sign convention} has also been chosen
in influential texts on GISAXS (e.g.\ \cite{ReLL09}).
Here, however, we are concerned not only with X-rays,
but also with neutrons,
and therefore we need to leave the Schrödinger equation~\cref{ESchrodi} intact.
Thence:

\Note
{\indent In this manual, and in the program code of \BornAgain,
the quantum-mechanical sign convention~\cref{Estationarywave} is chosen.
This has implications for the sign of the imaginary part of the
refractive index,
\index{Index of refraction|see {Refractive index}}
\index{Refractive index!sign convention}%
as explained in \Cref{Sabsorption}.}

Inserting \cref{Estationarywave} in \cref{ESchrodi},
we obtain the stationary Schrödinger equation
\begin{equation}\label{EstatSchrodi}
  \left\{-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\Nabla^2+V(\r)-\hbar\omega\right\} \psi(\r) = 0.

The \E{nuclear} (or \E{microscopic})
\E{optical potential} $V(\r)$,
in a somewhat ``naive conception'' \cite[p.~7]{Sea89},
consists of a sum of delta functions,
representing Fermi's ``pseudopotential''.
\index{Fermi's pseudopotential}%
The superposition of the incident wave with the scattered waves
originating from each illuminated nucleus
results in \E{coherent forward scattering},
\index{Coherent forward scattering}%
in line with Huygens' principle.
\index{Huygens' principle}%

Coherent superposition also leads to \E{Bragg scattering}.
\index{Bragg scattering!by atomic lattices}%
However, Bragg scattering by atomic lattices only occurs at angles
far above the small-angle range covered in GISAS experiments.
Accordingly, it can be neglected in the analysis of GISAS data,
or at most, is taken into account as a loss channel.

Therefore,
we can neglect the atomic structure of $V(\r)$,
and perform some coarse graining to
arrive at a \E{continuum approximation}.
\index{Continuum approximation!neutron propagation}%
This is
similar to the passage from
the microscopic to the macroscopic Maxwell equations.
The details are intricate \cite{Sea89,Lax51},
but the result \cite[eq.~2.8.32]{Sea89} looks very simple:
The macroscopic field equation
has still the form of a stationary Schrödinger equation,

\begin{equation}\label{EmacrSchrodi}

  = 4\pi\delta v(\r)\psi(\r).
\end{equation}
In a homogeneous medium with $\delta v=0$,
\cref{ESchrodi3} reduces to the Helmholtz wave equation.
This motivates us to rewrite~\cref{ESchrodi3} as
\Emph{
\begin{equation}\label{ESchrodiK}
  \left\{ \Nabla^2 + K^2 \right\}\psi(\r)

The Schrödinger equation \cref{ESchrodiK}

in Born approximation (\cref{SBornApprox}).
Later (\cref{Swave21}), for the special case of grazing incidence,
the distorted wave Born approximation (DWBA)

%===============================================================================
\subsection{The Born expansion}\label{SBornExpans}
%===============================================================================

\index{Born approximation|(}%

To describe an elastic scattering experiment,
we need to solve the Schrödinger equation~\cref{ESchrodiK}
under the asymptotic boundary condition
\begin{equation}\label{Escabouco}
  \psi(\r)
  \simeq \psi_\ti(\r) + f(\vartheta,\varphi)\frac{\e^{iKr}}{4\pi r}
  \text{~for~}r\to\infty,
\end{equation}
\nomenclature[1ψ034 2i000 2r040]{$\psi_\ti(\r)$}{Incident wavefunction}%
\nomenclature[2i000]{i}{Subscript ``incident''}%
where $\psi_\ti(\r)$ is the incident wave
as prepared by the experimental apparatus,
and the second term on the right-hand side is
the outgoing scattered wave
that carries information in form of the angular distribution
$f(\vartheta,\varphi)$.

For thermal or cold neutrons, as for X-rays,
the refractive index~$n$ is almost always very close to~1,
fluctuations of the scattering length density are at most of the order of $1-n$,
and therefore the right-hand side of~\cref{ESchrodiK}
is but a weak perturbation.
This suggests a solution of the Schrödinger equation
by means of a perturbation expansion in powers of $\delta v$,
known as the \E{Born expansion} or \E{Born series}.\footnote{
Named after Max Born
who introduced it in quantum mechanics.
The idea goes back to Lord Rayleigh
who devised it for sound,
and later also applied it to electromagnetic waves,
which resulted in his famous explanation of the blue sky.}

Equation~\cref{ESchrodiK} looks
like an inhomogeneous differential equation ---
except that the right-hand side contains the unknown function~$\psi$.
In the Born expansion this problem is solved by iteration.
We start with the homogeneous equation
\begin{equation}\label{EHelmholtzHomog}
  \left(\Nabla^2+K^2\right)\psi(\r) = 0,
\end{equation}
which is solved by plane waves and superpositions thereof.
It applies in particular to the incident wave~$\psi_\ti$.

For an isolated inhomogeneity,
\begin{equation}\label{EHelmholtzForGreen}
  \left(\Nabla^2+K^2\right)G(\r,\r') = \delta(\r-\r')
\end{equation}
\nomenclature[2g130 2r040 2r041]{$G(\r,\r')$}{Green function}%
\index{Green function!homogeneous material}%
is solved by the Green function\footnote
{Verification under the condition $\r\ne0$
is a straightforward exercise in vector analysis.
For the special case $\r=0$,
one encloses the origin in a small sphere
and integrates by means of the Gauss-Ostrogadsky divergence theorem.
This explains the appearance of the factor $4\pi$.}
\begin{equation}\label{EGreens1}
  G(\r,\r') = \frac{\e^{iK|\r-\r'|}}{4\pi |\r-\r'|},
\end{equation}
which is an outgoing spherical wave centered at $\r'$.
Convoluting this function with the given inhomogeneity $4\pi\delta v\psi$,
we obtain what is known as the Lippmann-Schwinger equation,
\index{Lippmann-Schwinger equation}%the formal solution
\begin{equation}\label{EPsiFormal}
  \psi(\r)
  = \psi_\ti(\r)
  + \int\!\d^3r'\, G(\r,\r') 4\pi\delta v(\r')\psi(\r').
\end{equation}
This integral equation for $\psi(\r)$ improves
upon the original stationary Schrödinger equation \cref{ESchrodiK}
in that it ensures the boundary condition~\cref{Escabouco}.
It can be resolved into an infinite series
by iteratively substituting the full right-hand side of~\cref{EPsiFormal}
into the integrand.
Successive terms in this series contain rising powers of $\delta v$.
Since $\delta v$ is assumed to be small, the series is likely to converge.
In \E{first-order Born approximation},
only the linear order in $\delta v$ is retained,
\begin{equation}\label{EBorn}
  \psi(\r)
  \doteq \psi_\ti(\r)
  + 4\pi \int\!\d^3r'\, G(\r,\r') \delta v(\r') \psi_\ti(\r').
\end{equation}
This is practically always adequate for
material investigations with X-rays or neutrons,
where the aim is to
deduce $\delta v(\r')$ from the scattered intensity ${|\psi(\r)|}^2$.
Since detectors are always placed at positions $\r$
that are not illuminated by the incident beam,
we are only interested in the scattered wave field
\begin{equation}\label{EBornS}
  \psi_\text{s}(\r)
  \coloneqq
  4\pi \int\!\d^3r'\, G(\r,\r') \delta v(\r') \psi_\ti(\r').

\index{Born approximation|)}%

%===============================================================================
\subsection{Far-field approximation}
%===============================================================================

\index{Far-field approximation|(}%

We can further simplify \cref{EBornS}
under the conditions of Fraunhofer diffraction:
\index{Fraunhofer approximation}%
the distance from the sample to the detector location~$\r$
must be much larger than the size of the sample.
Since the scattered wave $\psi_\text{s}(\r)$
only depends on $\r$ through the Green function~$G(\r,\r')$,
we shall derive a far-field approximation for the latter.

We choose the origin within the sample
so that the integral in~\cref{EBornS} runs over $\r'$ with $r'\ll r$.
This allows us to expand
\begin{equation}
  \left|\r-\r'\right|
  \doteq \sqrt{r^2-2\r\,\r'}
  \doteq r - \frac{\r\,\r'}{r}
  \equiv r - \frac{\k_\tf \r'}{K},

\nomenclature[2k040]{$\k$}{wavevector}%
where we have introduced the outgoing wavevector
\begin{equation}
  \k_\tf\coloneqq K\frac{\r}{r}.
\end{equation}
We apply this to~\cref{EGreens1},
\index{Green function!homogeneous material}%
and obtain in leading order the far-field Green function
\begin{equation}\label{EGreenFar}
  G_\text{far}(\r,\r')
  = \frac{\e^{iKr}}{4\pi r}\psi^*_\tf(\r')
\end{equation}
\nomenclature[2g134 2far]{$G_\text{far}(\r,\r')$}{Far-field
   approximation to the Green function $G(\r,\r')$}%
where
\begin{equation}
  \psi_\tf(\r) \coloneqq  \e^{i\k_\tf \r}
\end{equation}
\nomenclature[1ψ034 2f000 2r040]{$\psi_\tf(\r)$}{Plane
  wave propagating from the sample towards the detector}%
is a plane wave propagating towards the detector,
and $\psi^*$ designates the complex conjugate of $\psi$.
With respect to $\r$, $G_\text{far}$ is an outgoing spherical wave.

The scattered wave~\cref{EBornS}
becomes in the far-field approximation
\begin{equation}\label{EsandwichC}
  \psi_\text{s,far}(\r)
  = \frac{\e^{iKr}}{r}
    \bra \psi_\tf|\delta v|\psi_\ti\ket,
\end{equation}
\nomenclature[1ψ034 2s000 2far]{$\psi_\text{s,far}(\r)$}{Far-field
   approximation to the scattered wavefunction $\psi_\text{s}(\r)$}%
where we used Dirac notation for the transition matrix element
\index{Transition matrix}%
\begin{equation}\label{Etrama}
  \bra \psi_\tf|\delta v|\psi_\ti\ket
  \coloneqq  \int\!\d^3r\, \psi^*_\tf(\r)\delta v(\r)\psi_\ti(\r).

\nomenclature[0$\langle$0]{{$\bra\ldots\vert\ldots\vert\ldots\ket$}}{Matrix

In order to reconcile conflicting sign conventions,
we will in the following rather use its complex conjugate
$\bra \psi_\ti|\delta v|\psi_\tf\ket = \bra \psi_\tf|\delta v|\psi_\ti\ket^*$.
Under the standard assumption
that the incident radiation is a plane wave
\begin{equation}\label{EPsi0Plane}
  \psi_\ti(\r)=\e^{i \k_\ti \r}
\end{equation}
with $k_\ti=K$,
the matrix element takes the form
\begin{equation}\label{Echiq}
  \bra \psi_\ti|\delta v|\psi_\tf\ket
  = \int\!\d^3r\, {\rm e}^{-i\k_\ti\r}\delta v(\r){\rm e}^{i\k_\tf\r}
  = \int\!\d^3r\, {\rm e}^{i\q\r}\delta v(\r)

\index{Sign convention!scattering vector}%
$\hbar\q$ is the momentum

\E{gained} by the scattered neutron,
and \E{lost} by the sample.
In much of the literature the opposite convention is prefered,
since it emphasizes the sample physics over the scattering experiment.
However, when working with two-dimensional detectors
it is highly desirable to express pixel coordinates

and scattering vector components
with respect to equally oriented coordinate axes,
which can only be achieved by the convention~\cref{Eq}.}

%===============================================================================
\subsection{Differential cross section}\label{SdiffCross}
%===============================================================================

In connection with \cref{EBorn} we mentioned
that a scattering experiment measures intensities~${|\psi(\r)|}^2$.
We shall now restate this in a more rigorous way.
In the case of neutron scattering,
one actually measures a \E{probability flux}.
We define it in arbitrary relative units as
\begin{equation}\label{EdefJ}
  \v{J}(\r) \coloneqq  \psi^*\frac{\Nabla}{2i}\psi - \psi\frac{\Nabla}{2i}\psi^*.
\end{equation}
\nomenclature[2j150 2r040]{$\v{J}(\r)$}{Probability flux}%
\index{Flux!incident and scattered}%
The ratio of the scattered flux hitting an infinitesimal detector area
$r^2\d\Omega$ to the incident flux is expressed as a
\E{differential cross section}
\index{Cross section}%
\begin{equation}\label{Exsectiondef}
  \frac{\d\sigma}{\d\Omega}
  \coloneqq  \frac{r^2 J(\r)}{J_\ti}.
\end{equation}
\nomenclature[1ω120]{$\Omega$}{Solid angle}%
\nomenclature[1σ020]{$\sigma$}{Scattering or absorption cross section}%
% TODO RESTORE XREF
% The geometric factors that are needed to
% convert $\d\sigma/\d\Omega$ into detector counts will be discussed
% below in \cref{SdetImg}.

With \cref{EPsi0Plane}, the incident flux is
\begin{equation}\label{EJi}
  \v{J}_\ti = \k_\ti.
\end{equation}
With \cref{EsandwichC}, the scattered flux at the detector is
\begin{equation}\label{EJr}
  \v{J}(\r)
  = \v{\hat r}\frac{K}{r^2}
    {\left|\bra\psi_\ti|\delta v|\psi_\tf\ket\right|}^2.
\end{equation}
From \cref{Exsectiondef} we obtain
the generic differential cross section
of elastic scattering in first order Born approximation,
\Emph{
\begin{equation}\label{Exsection}
  \frac{\d\sigma}{\d\Omega}
  =  {\left|\bra\psi_\ti|\delta v|\psi_\tf\ket\right|}^2.
\end{equation}\vspace*{-5pt}
}
As we shall see below,
it holds not only for plane waves governed
by the vacuum Helmholtz equation~\cref{EHelmholtzHomog},
but also for distorted waves.

In the plane-wave case \cref{Echiq} considered here,
the differential cross section is just the squared modulus
of the Fourier transform of the perturbative potential,
\begin{equation}\label{Ecross1}
  \frac{\d\sigma}{\d\Omega}
  = {\left| v(\q) \right|}^2.
\end{equation}

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To conclude this chapter on the foundations of small-angle scattering,
we shall derive the geometric factors
that allow us to convert differential cross sections into detector counts.
We shall also discuss how to present data on a physically meaningful scale.

%===============================================================================
\subsection{Pixel coordinates, scattering angles, and $\symbf{q}$ components}
%===============================================================================

We assume that scattered radiation is detected in a flat,
two-dimensional detector
that generates histograms on a rectangular grid,
consisting of $n\cdot m$ pixels of constant width and height,
as sketched in \cref{FexpGeom}.
This figure also shows the coordinate system
\index{Conventions|see {Coordinate system}}%
\index{Coordinate system}%
according to unanimous GISAS convention,
with $z$ normal to the sample plane,
and with the incident beam in the $xz$ plane.
The origin is at the center of the sample surface.
We suppose that the detector is mounted perpendicular to the $x$ axis
at a distance $L$ from the sample position.
%the $x$ axis intersects the detector plane at $(L,y_\tc,z_\tc)$.
The real-space coordinate at the center of pixel $(i,j)$ is $(L,y_i,z_i)$.
Each pixel has a width~$\Delta y$ and a height~$\Delta z$.
\index{Detector!pixel coordinate}%
\index{Pixel|see {Detector}}%

The affine-linear conversion from pixel indices $i,j$ to pixel coordinates $x_i,y_i$
requires an experimental calibration of the origin.
\Work{How is this done in \BornAgain?}
\index{Detector!calibration}%

Since the differential scattering cross section \cref{Exsectiondef}
is given with respect to a solid-angle element $\d\Omega$,
we need to express the scattered wavevector $\k_\tf$ in spherical coordinates,
using the horizontal azimuth angle~$\phi_\tf$
and the vertical glancing angle $\alpha_\tf$.
The projection of $(\alpha_\tf,\phi_\tf)$ into
the detector plane~$(y,z)$ is known as the \E{gnomonic projection}.
\index{Gnomonic projection}%
\index{Projection!wave vector to pixel coordinate}%
\index{Mapping!wave vector to pixel coordinate}%
\index{Transformation!wave vector to pixel coordinate}%
From elementary trigonometry one finds
\begin{equation}\label{Eyzdet}
  \begin{array}{lcl}
  y &=& L \tan\phi_\tf,\\
  z &=& (L/ \cos\phi_\tf) \tan\alpha_\tf.
  \end{array}
\end{equation}
\cref{Fconstalphi} shows lines of equal $\alpha_\tf$,~$\phi_\tf$
in the detector plane.
To emphasize the curvature of the constant-$\alpha_\tf$ lines,
scattering angles up to more than 25$^\circ$ are shown.
In typical SAS or GISAS,
scattering angles are much smaller,
and therefore the mapping between pixel coordinates and
scattering angles is in a good first approximation linear.
Of course \BornAgain\ is not restricted to this linear regime,
but uses the exact nonlinear mapping~\cref{Eyzdet}.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The black dot indicates the beamstop location for
the central incident beam (SAS geometry, $\hat\k_\ti = \hat x$).}
\label{Fconstalphi}
\end{figure}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To determine the scattering vector $\q_{ij}$
that corresponds to a pixel $(i,j)$,
we need to express the outgoing wavevector~$\k_\tf$ as function of $y$ and~$z$.
This can be done either by inverting \cref{Eyzdet}
and inserting the so obtained $\alpha_\tf(y,z)$ and $\phi_\tf(y)$ in
\begin{equation}\label{Ekf_by_angle}
  \k_\tf=K\left(\begin{array}{c}
   \cos\alpha_\tf\cos\phi_\tf\\
   \cos\alpha_\tf\sin\phi_\tf\\
   \sin\alpha_\tf\end{array}\right),
\end{equation}
or much more directly by using geometric similarity in Cartesian coordinates.
The result is rather simple:
\Emph{
\begin{equation}\label{Ekf_by_pixel}
  \k_\tf=\frac{K}{\sqrt{L^2+y^2+z^2}}\left(\begin{array}{c}
   L\\
   y\\

The transform \cref{Eqalgo} between pixel coordinates $y$,~$z$
and physical scattering vector components $q_y$, $q_z$
is nonlinear, due to the square-root term in the denominator of~\cref{Ekf_by_pixel}.
For $y,z\ll L$, however, nonlinear terms loose importance.

The incoming wavelength is 0.1~nm.

the length $L_x$, in beam direction, is varied as shown above the plots.
\index{Circular modulation!of detector image as function of $q_x$}
The circular modulation comes from a factor $\sinc(q_x L_x/2)$
in the cuboid form factor, with $q_x$ given by~\cref{Eqxasy}.}
\label{Fdetbox}

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The left detector frame in \cref{Fconstq}
shows circles of constant values of $\pm q_x$.
For given steps in $q_x$, the distance between adjacent circles
increases towards the detector center.
From \cref{Eq} and \cref{Ekf_by_pixel},
one finds asymptotically for $y,z\to L$
that $q_x$ goes with the square of the two other components of the scattering vector,
\begin{equation}\label{Eqxasy}
  \frac{q_x}{K}
  \doteq \frac{y^2+z^2}{2 L^2}
  \doteq \frac{q_y^2 + q_z^2}{2K^2}.
\end{equation}
Therefore, under typical small angle conditions $y,z\to L$
the dependence of the scattering signal on $q_x$ is unimportant:
one basically measures $v(\q)\simeq v(0,q_y,q_z)$.
The exception, for sample structures with long correlations in $x$~direction,
is illustrated in~\cref{Fdetbox}.

\label{Fconstp}
\end{figure}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As anticipated in \cref{Eqxasy},
the other two components of $\q$ are in first order linear in the pixel coordinates,
\begin{equation}
  \frac{q_y}{K}=\frac{y}{L}\left(1-\frac{y^2+z^2}{2L^2}+\ldots\right),
\end{equation}
and similarly for~$q_z$.
The nonlinear correction terms lead to the pincushion distortion
shown in the right detector frame in \cref{Fconstq}.
\index{Distortion!of $q_x$, $q_y$ grid in detector plane}%
\index{Detector!distortion of $q_x$, $q_y$ grid}%
\index{Pincushion distortion}%

Since pixel coordinates are meaningful only
with respect to a specific experimental setup,
users may wish to transform detector images
towards the physical coordinates $q_y$ and~$q_z$.
As shown in \cref{Fconstp},
this would yield a barrel-shaped illuminated area
in the $q_y$,~$q_z$~plane.

To summarize this section,
the wavevector $\q_{ij}$ can be determined from the pixel indices
through the following steps:
\begin{equation}\label{Eqalgo}
  \begin{array}{cl}
      (i,j)&\\
      \downarrow&\mbox{calibrate of origin, then employ affine-linear mapping}\\
      (y,z)\\
      \downarrow&\mbox{use (\protect\ref{Ekf_by_pixel})}\\
      \k_\tf&\\
      \downarrow&\mbox{use (\protect\ref{Eq})}\\
      \q&\\
  \end{array}
\end{equation}

\Note{\indent Transforming detector images
  from pixel coordinates into the $q_y$,~$q_z$~plane is not implemented in \BornAgain,
  and not on our agenda.
  We would, however, like to hear about use cases.}

\Emph{\indent When simulating and fitting experimental data with \BornAgain,
detector images remain unchanged.
All work is done in terms of reduced pixel coordinates $y/L$ and~$z/L$.
Corrections are applied to the simulated, not to the measured data.}

\subsection{Intensity transformation}

The solid angle under which a detector pixel
is illuminated from the sample is in linear approximation
\begin{equation}
  \Delta\Omega
  = \cos\alpha_\tf\:\Delta\alpha_\tf\,\Delta\phi_\tf
  = \cos\alpha_\tf
    \left|\frac{\partial(\alpha_\tf,\phi_\tf)}{\partial(y,z)}\right|
    \Delta y \,\Delta z
  = \cos^3\!\alpha_\tf\, \cos^3\!\phi_\tf\: \frac{\Delta y \,\Delta z}{L^2}.
\end{equation}
\index{Detector!illumination angle correction factor}%
\index{Illumination!detector}%
Altogether,
the expected count rate in detector pixel $(i,j)$ is proportional to
\begin{equation}\label{EItrafo_cos}
  I_{ij} = \cos^3\!\alpha_\tf\, \cos^3\!\phi_\tf\:
          \frac{\partial\sigma}{\partial\Omega}(\q_{ij}),
\end{equation}
where we have omitted constant factors $L^{-2}$, $\Delta y$ and $\Delta z$.
Using pixel coordinates instead of angles, this can be rewritten as
\Emph{%
\begin{equation}\label{EItrafo_pix}
  I_{ij} = \left( 1+\frac{y^2+z^2}{L^2}\right)^{-3/2}
          \frac{\partial\sigma}{\partial\Omega}\bigl(\q_{ij}(y,z)\bigr).
\end{equation}
\vspace*{-2pt}}
%(usually as the centre between the transmitted
%and the specularly reflected beam spot).

%Tradition wants that raw data be \E{treated} or \E{reduced}
%before they are \E{analyzed}.
%In our case, raw data reduction would comprise
%the transform \cref{Eqalgo} of pixel coordinates into scattering vectors,
%and the accompanying renormalization \cref{EItrafo} of pixel counts.
