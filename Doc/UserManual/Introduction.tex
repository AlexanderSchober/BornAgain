\mychapter{0}{Introduction}

%\BornAgain\ is a  software to simulate and fit neutron and X-ray
%scattering at grazing incidence. It is a multi–platform open–source project that aims at %supporting scientists in the analysis and fitting
%of their GISAS data, both for synchrotron (GISAXS) and neutron (GISANS) facilities. 

\BornAgain\ is a free and open-source software package
to simulate and fit small-angle
scattering at grazing incidence (GISAS). 
It supports analysis of both  X-ray (GISAXS) and neutron (GISANS) data.
Its name, \BornAgain, indicates the central role of the distorted-wave Born
approximation (DWBA) in the physical description of the
scattering process. The software provides a generic framework for modeling multilayer samples with smooth or
rough interfaces and with various types of embedded nano\-particles.

\BornAgain\ almost completely reproduces the functionality
of the widely used program \IsGISAXS\
by R. Lazzari \cite{Laz02}.
\BornAgain\ goes beyond \IsGISAXS\ by
supporting an unrestricted number of layers and particles, 
diffuse reflection from rough layer interfaces,
particles with inner structures, neutron polarization and magnetic scattering.
Adhering to a strict object-oriented design,
\BornAgain\ provides a solid base for future extensions
in response to specific user needs.

\BornAgain\ is a platform-independent software,
with active support for Linux, MacOS and 
Microsoft Windows. 
It is a free and open source software provided under the terms
of the GNU General Public License (GPL).

Software and documentation are work in progress.
We cannot guarantee that they are accurate and correct.
Anyway, it is entirely in the responsibility of users
to ensure that their data interpretation is physically meaningful.
If in doubt, please contact us.
We are grateful for all kind of feedback:
criticism, praise, bug reports, feature requests or contributed modules.
If questions go beyond normal software user support,
we will be glad to discuss a scientific collaboration.

This User Manual is complementary to the online documentation
at \url{http://www.bornagainproject.org}.
In particular, for download and installation instructions,
\SecRef{QuickStart} just refers there.
\SecRef{Simulation} describes
the general methodology of a simulation with \BornAgain,
and gives detailed usage examples.
\SecRef{ScatteringCrosssection} explains
which sample structures are supported in \BornAgain,
and which physical approximations are used.
Fitting is explained in \SecRef{Fitting}.

More theoretical background is given in Appendix~\ref{app:theory}.
Implemented particle formfactors are specified in Appendix~\ref{app:ff}.
