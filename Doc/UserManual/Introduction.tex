%\BornAgain\ is a  software to simulate and fit neutron and X-ray
%scattering at grazing incidence. It is a multi–platform open–source project that aims at %supporting scientists in the analysis and fitting
%of their GISAS data, both for synchrotron (GISAXS) and neutron (GISANS) facilities. 

\BornAgain\ is a free software package to simulate and fit small-angle
scattering at grazing incidence (GISAS). 
It supports analysis of both  X-ray (GISAXS) and neutron (GISANS) data.
Its name, \BornAgain, indicates the central role of the distorted-wave Born
approximation (DWBA) in the physical description of the
scattering process. The software provides a generic framework for modeling multilayer samples with smooth or
rough interfaces and with various types of embedded nano\-particles.

\BornAgain\ almost completely reproduces the functionality
of the widely used program \IsGISAXS\
by R. Lazzari \cite{Laz02}.
%\BornAgain\ is intended  to reproduce the functionality
%of the widely used program \IsGISAXS\
%by R. Lazzari \cite{Laz02}.

\BornAgain\ goes beyond \IsGISAXS\ by
supporting an unrestricted number of layers and particles, 
diffuse reflection from rough layer interfaces,
particles with inner structures, neutron polarization and magnetic scattering.
Adhering to a strict object-oriented design,
\BornAgain\ provides a solid base for future extensions
in response to specific user needs.

\BornAgain\ is a platform-independent software,
with active support for Linux, MacOS and 
Microsoft Windows. 
It is a free and open source software provided under the terms
of the GNU General Public License (GPL).
