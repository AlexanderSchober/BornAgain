\section{Introduction}

\BornAgain\ is a  software to simulate and fit neutron and X-ray
scattering at grazing incidence. It is a multi–platform open–source project that aims at supporting scientists in the analysis and fitting
of their GISAS data, both for synchrotron (GISAXS) and neutron (GISANS) facilities. The name of the software,
\BornAgain\, indicates the central role of the distorted-wave Born
approximation (DWBA) in the physical description of the
scattering process. The software provides a generic framework for modeling multilayer samples with smooth or
rough interfaces and with various types of embedded nanoparticles. In this way, it reproduces and enhances the
functionality of the present reference software, \IsGISAXS\ by
R. Lazzari \cite{Lazzari:vi0158}, and lays a solid base for future
extensions in response to specific user needs. 

To meet the growing demand for GISAS simulation of more
complex structured materials, BornAgain has extended the IsGISAXS program’s functionality by removing the
restrictions on the number of layers and particles, by providing diffuse reflection from rough layer interfaces and
by adding particles with inner structure.

%For details about the theory (DWBA,\ldots), please refer to IsGISAXS manual \cite{IsGISAXSManual}.


The user guide starts with a brief description of steps necessary for compiling and running
the simulation, \SecRef{QuickStart}. More detailed overview of software architecture and
installation procedure is given in \SecRef{installation}.
General methodology of simulation with \BornAgain\ and detailed usage examples are given
in \SecRef{Examples}.
Fitting tools provided by the frame work are presented in \SecRef{Fitting}.
