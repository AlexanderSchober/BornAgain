\chapter*{Introduction}

%\BornAgain\ is a  software to simulate and fit neutron and X-ray
%scattering at grazing incidence. It is a multi–platform open–source project that aims at %supporting scientists in the analysis and fitting
%of their GISAS data, both for synchrotron (GISAXS) and neutron (GISANS) facilities. 

\BornAgain\ is a  software to simulate and fit small-angle
scattering at grazing incidence (GISAS). 
It supports analysis of both  X-ray (GISAXS) and neutron (GISANS) data.
Its name, \BornAgain, indicates the central role of the distorted-wave Born
approximation (DWBA) in the physical description of the
scattering process. The software provides a generic framework for modeling multilayer samples with smooth or
rough interfaces and with various types of embedded nano\-particles.

\BornAgain\ almost completely reproduces the functionality
of the widely used program \IsGISAXS\
by R. Lazzari \cite{Laz02}.
As novel features, \BornAgain\
supports an unrestricted number of layers and particles, 
diffuse reflection from rough layer interfaces,
and particles with inner structures.
Support for polarized neutrons and magnetic scattering is forthcoming.
Adhering to a strict object-oriented design,
\BornAgain\ provides a solid base for future extensions
in response to specific user needs.

\BornAgain\ is platform-independent software,
with active support for Linux, MacOS and 
Microsoft Windows (forthcoming). 
It is a free and open source software provided under terms
of GNU General Public License (GPL).

This user guide starts with a brief description of the steps necessary for compiling 
the source code and running
the simulation in \SecRef{QuickStart}. More detailed overview of software architecture and
installation procedure are given in \SecRef{SoftwareArchitecture} and \SecRef{Installation}.
General methodology of simulation with \BornAgain\ and detailed usage examples are given
in Chapter~\ref{ExamplesChapter}.%\SecRef{Examples}.
%Fitting tools provided by the framework are presented in \SecRef{Fitting}.
