\part{Reference}\label{PREF}
\chapter{Basics}\label{SRefBas}

This Reference is organized top-down: We start with top-level classes like
\texttt{GISAS\-Simulation};
then we explain the classes needed to set up a meaningful simulation.
For an alphabetic lookup of classes and functions,
see the general Index at the end of this Manual.
For classes and functions not explained here,
see the automatically generated Doxygen documentation.

\section{Simulation classes}\label{SRefSim}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Each BornAgain simulation is run from one of the three
foundational simulation classes:\footnote
{Developer note: They all inherit from a common interface class \ttIdx{Simulation}.}
\ttIdx{GISAS\-Simulation},
\ttIdx{OffSpecularSimulation},
\ttIdx{SpecularSimulation}.
