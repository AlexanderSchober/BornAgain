\chapter{The three interfaces of \BornAgain}  \label{sec:API3}

The core of \BornAgain\
\index{Core|see {\Code{libBornAgainCore}}}
For a given model,
\BornAgain\ provides an efficient computation of the expected detector image.
Furthermore \BornAgain\ comes with various minimizers that optimize model parameters
to fit the simulated detector image to a given experimental image.

All this functionality is implemented in a library, \Code{libBornAgainCore}.
\index{libBornAgainCore@\Code{libBornAgainCore}}
This library, in turn, depends on a number of other libraries,
as indicated in \cref{Farchi}.
One of these libraries, the minimizer wrapper \Code{libBornAgainFit}
\index{libBornAgainFit@\Code{libBornAgainFit}}
\index{Minimizers|see \Code{libBornAgainFit}}
has been written specifically for use in \BornAgain,
and for the time being is only distributed as part of \BornAgain,
though in the future it may find applications in other contexts.
The other library dependences of \Code{libBornAgainCore}
are multi-purpose libraries that are easily available as open-source packages.
