\chapter{Sample}\label{SRefSam}

\section{Multilayer}\label{SRefMuLay}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Samples in BornAgain are always of type \ttIdx{MultiLayer}.

\setCpp
\begin{lstlisting}
class MultiLayer {
    MultiLayer(); // constructor
    void addLayer(const Layer& p_child);
    void addLayerWithTopRoughness(const Layer& layer, const LayerRoughness& roughness);
};
\end{lstlisting}

A \texttt{MultiLayer} consists of one or more layers,
numbered from top to bottom as shown in~\cref{Fdefz}.
The function \clFct{MultiLayer}{addLayer} or \clFct{MultiLayer}{addLayerWithTopRoughness}
inserts one \ttIdx{Layer} at the high-index, low-$z$ end.

The \texttt{Layer} API is documented in~\cref{SRefLayer},
the \ttIdx{LayerRoughness} in~\cref{SRefRough}.

A minimal sample, consisting of a substrate under air,
can be constructed with the following Python code:

\setPy
\begin{lstlisting}
sample = MultiLayer()
sample.addLayer(air_layer)
sample.addLayer(substrate_layer)
\end{lstlisting}
