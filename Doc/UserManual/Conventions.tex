\mychapter{0}{Typesetting conventions}

In this manual, we use the following typesetting conventions:

\medskip
\Warn{Such a box is used to highlight
a \textbf{warning} about potential problems
with the software or the documentation.}

\medskip

\medskip\noindent
If an entire section is missing, then we insert just this short placeholder:
\MissingSection

\medskip
\Note{Such a box is used to highlight
  an \textbf{implementation note} that explains
  how the theory exposed in this manual is actually used in \BornAgain.}

\medskip
\Emph{Such a box is used to highlight

  the further development of the theory.}
