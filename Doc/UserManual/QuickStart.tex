This User Manual is complementary to the online documentation
at the project web site \url{http://www.bornagainproject.org};
it does not duplicate technical information that is more conveniently
available there.
The \textsc{Download} section offers
binary packages and a source archive.
The \textsc{Documentation} section contains an overview
of the functionality,
detailed installation instructions,
tutorials and usage examples.
