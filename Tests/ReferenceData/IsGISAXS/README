This folder contains example data from IsGISAXS for comparison with BornAgain

In each subdirectory, one finds:
- one or multiple .inp files, containing IsGISAXS model description
- isgi_*.ima files with simulated intensity produced by IsGISAXS

List of examples:
ex-1   Mixture of cylinders and prisms without interference.
ex-2   Two gaussian size cylinder distribution.
ex-3   Cylinder formfactor in BA and DWBA.
ex-4   1D and 2D paracrystal.
ex-5   1D paracrystal fit example.
ex-6   2D lattice with different disorders.
ex-7   Mixture of different particles defined in morphology file.
ex-8   2DDL paracrystal 
ex-9   Rotated pyramids on top of substrate.
ex-10  Cylinders with interference on top of substrate.
ex-11  Core shell nano particles.
ex-12  Constrained fit example: mixture of two cylinder types
ex-13  Simulated annealing fit example.
ex-14  Layered spheres on graded interface.
ex-15  Size spacing correlation approximation

Some notes:
-Since polarization (x-ray) is not yet included in BornAgain, this feature should be disabled in IsGISAXS by returning 1._wp from function PolFac in Reflectivity_mod.f90
-IsGISAXS initializes the arrays of outgoing angles such that their sines are evenly spaced. This necessitates a different initialization in BornAgain too: see GISASExperiment::setDetectorParameters function
