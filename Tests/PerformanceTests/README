This script replaces the performance test functionality of App.

Example usage:

python3 test_performance.py ../../dev-tools/log/perf_history.txt

This will perform the tests and append the summary to the file
"perf_history.txt". If the filename argument is left blank, the
script will simply write the results to stdout.
