Collection of functional tests (C++)

Collection contains functional tests for BornAgainCore library.
Each test defines simple geometry, runs simulation and then compare results of the simulation with reference data.

To build all tests
qmake; make

To run tests
python TestCore.py

Tests taken from IsGISAXS:
IsGISAXS01 - Mixture of cylinders and prisms without interference

IsGISAXS03 - Cylinder formfactor in BA and DWBA
IsGISAXS04 - 1D and 2D paracrystal
IsGISAXS06 - 2D lattice with different disorder
IsGISAXS07 - Mixture of different particles defined in morphology file
IsGISAXS08 - 2DDL paracrystal
