Collection of functional tests (C++)

Collection of standalone fitting tests using various minimizers and objective functions.
No BornAgain simulation involved.

Tests are compiled and executed automatically when user builds
the whole project with 'check' target cmake; make check

One can run tests manually by running in the build directory ./bin/FitKernel
